# UFOs

# Project Overview 

In this project, build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Also created a filter to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Customize webpage by using Bootstrap, and equip tables with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations.

## Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria.
Using JavaScript and HTML, I modify the code in the index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter created in this module, add filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## UFO Sightings Result Page

The webpage includes five different filter search boxes on the left side of the page, which includes the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Filtering on the webpage can be either done by entering the filter formation into the filter search box. The results of the information entered into the filter search box will return the UFOs sightings for the exact information entered in the filter search.


## Summary 

### Drawback of the Webpage
  * Having five different filter search boxes makes it difficult for users to understand how to use them.
  * A dropdown list should be included in each filter search box.
### Recommendation To Improve the Webpage 
  * Creating another filter search bar to find the lengths of the UFOs.
  * Adding another filter button below the filter search will serve as the enter button for all five filter searches.
